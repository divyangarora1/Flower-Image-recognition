# Flower-Image-recognition
Using Deep Learning and CNN to train images of flowers 
I have used Deep Learning techniques with Keras to train the 4000+ images of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks and many techniques Maxpooling , Dropout , Densing , Adagrad and many more
You need to download the data set change the path of the data set and then you need to run the python code given.
